Devise - Imapable
=================

Devise-Imapable is a imap based authentication strategy for the [Devise](User/Project: plataformatec/devise) authentication framework.

If you are building applications for use within your organisation which require authentication and don't have access to a LDAP server, using imap can be a great alternative.

Installation
============

Currently this can only be installed as a plugin.
